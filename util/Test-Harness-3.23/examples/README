=head2 Running Tests in Multiple Languages

If you have ruby installed in C</usr/bin/ruby>, and also have
C<Test::WWW::Mechanize> installed, you can cd into C<examples/> (the directory
where this README lives) and run the following command after installing the
C<runtests> utility:

 examples $ runtests --exec ./my_exec t -v - < test_urls.txt
 t/10-stuff..............Failed 1/6 tests
         (less 2 skipped tests: 3 okay)
         (1 test unexpectedly succeeded)
 t/ruby..................ok   
 http://www.google.com/....ok   
 http://www.yahoo.com/.....ok   
 
 Test Summary Report
 -------------------
 t/10-stuff.t          (Wstat: 256 Tests: 6 Failed: 1)
   Failed tests:  2
   TODO passed:   6
   uests skipped: 3-4
 Files=4, Tests=10,  3 wallclock secs ( 0.92 cusr +  0.23 csys =  1.15 CPU)

The C<my_exec> is a Perl program which tells the test harness how to execute
any tests it encounters.

The C<t> argument tells it to search in the C<t/> directory for any tests.
One of the tests it finds is written in Ruby, but the C<my_exec> program tells
it how to run this test.  If you have Ruby installed but the test fails, try
changing the path.  If you don't have Ruby installed, you can simply comment
out those lines in C<my_exec>, but the test will fail.

The C<-> tells C<runtests> to read from C<STDIN> and C<test_urls.txt> is
merely a list of URLs we wish to test.

See the documentation for C<runtests> and C<TAP::Harness> for more
information about how to use this.

The C<-v> tells the harness to run in verbose mode.

=head2 Custom Test Harnesses

The C<tprove*> harnesses in the C<examples/bin/> directory are deprecated in
favor of the new C<runtests>/C<TAP::Harness> tools.  They are left in primary
for curiosity sake, though you may find the C<tprove_gtk> one useful as a
reference for how to create a GUI interface for C<TAP::Parser>.

Instead, simple override the desired methods in C<TAP::Harness> to create
your own custom test harness.  Don't like how the summary report is formatted?
Just override the C<&TAP::Harness::summary> method and use your new subclass:

 runtests --harness TAP::Harness::MyHarness
